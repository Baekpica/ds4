#!/bin/bash
# speed-bench/credit_tranche_gate.sh — MT-1b (v0.6.1 memory truth): tranche
# decode credits + mid-flight extension (DS4_CONT_ADMIT_TRANCHE).
#
# The phantom this kills: every omitted-max_tokens request used to hold a
# LIFETIME credit for the server's full default decode budget (393216 tok)
# from admission until row end -- ~1.6 GiB of never-decoded future charged
# per agent-style admission (the leg-1 codex deep-bank refusal anatomy).
# With the tranche, admission credits min(prompt + min(budget, T), seq_cap)
# and the decode loop extends the credit tranche-by-tranche under the SAME
# funding verdict (ds4_batch_cont_fund_check).  An extension refusal pins
# the row to its funded boundary: it finishes there with finish=length --
# strictly better than the legacy shape, which refused the whole request.
#
# Legs (ctx 16384 x 4 banks; the omitted-budget normalized mn ~= 16.3K, so
# a pinned tranche bites without a deep boot; unions are MEASURED via
# DS4_ADMIT_DEBUG -- mres+mneed is the timing-independent lifetime union,
# the admission_credit_gate.sh law):
#   CAL:  two default-budget boots (tranche=2048 / tranche=0) x 4 concurrent
#         omitted-budget rows -> record union(4) each side; assert the
#         tranche saves >= 40 MiB (the pessimism being deleted) and that
#         the admit-debug discloses decode_budget=2048 on the tranche side.
#   T/K:  budget pinned to the midpoint of the two measured unions.
#         T (tranche=2048): all four rows admit, zero rejects.
#         K (tranche=0, the kill switch): the legacy over-credit REPRODUCES
#         the refusal ('rejected on comp-cache budget') at the same budget
#         -- the leg-1 pessimism class, at gate scale.
#   X:    extension walk (tranche=512, default budget): a long row crosses
#         its first boundary -> ds4_cont_credit_extension_granted_total
#         advances; no refusal line.
#   XR:   extension refusal (tranche=4096, budget pinned to the measured
#         single-row admission union + 4 MiB): the first boundary's
#         next-tranche pages cannot fit -> refusal line + refused counter,
#         and THE REQUEST STILL COMPLETES with finish_reason "length"
#         (the funded-boundary invariant made client-visible); a follow-up
#         row admits clean after row end (credit released).
#
# External live-memory loss stays mem_floor_gate.sh's leg; this gate's boots
# assert the floor line NEVER fires (budget verdicts only).
# Runs FROM the Mac over SSH.  End state: ds4-server killed, box left free.
