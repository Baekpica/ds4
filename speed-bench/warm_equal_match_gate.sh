# speed-bench/warm_equal_match_gate.sh — #10: equal-length record vs the
# full-match scan, ranked by DELIVERED TOKENS.
#
# The full-match scan requires record.len < prompt.len STRICTLY, so a
# prompt equal to a record (the 378855/41 aborted-thinking
# prompt-as-record shape) could never win it, and an older shorter
# full-prefix record was preferred -- re-prefilling the tail.  The fix
# defers the full match when the best partial candidate's ACTUAL token
# cut strictly beats the full record's committed length (bytes are only
# a prefilter: sampled-vs-canonical divergence -- think blocks, splice
# points -- caps the canonical LCP, so byte ranking over-promises;
# first gate run measured a 160-token loss on a small-delta shape).
#
# Drive (the 378855/41 field chain itself, all on one ~12k request):
#   T1 send P, kill mid-PREFILL (~6 s of ~15 s) -> aborted admission
#      keeps the WATERMARK as a record (canonical tokens; bank A, the
#      short full-match competitor; parse WA from the log line).
#   T2 resend P, kill mid-THINK (~22 s) -> aborted thinking row keeps
#      the PROMPT as its record (bank B, equal-length; committed =
#      canonical watermark splice + think tail).
#   T3 resend P to completion: the probe.
#
# ADJUDICATION (08-05, three gate iterations): in SPLICE lineages (any
# bank whose admission reused another record) the canonical token-LCP
# dies at the splice/think boundary, so an equal-length record can never
# deliver more than the full-match competitor -- the docket premise
# ("prompt record 39136 was reusable") was FALSE: its deliverable was
# the observed cut=26208 < trunk 26210.  The refined matcher measures
# delivered tokens per admission and only defers the full match when the
# partial strictly wins (cold-canonical lineages).  This gate asserts
# THE GUARD on the splice shape: byte-bait must NOT flip the pick, and
# the full match's exact-splice reuse is preserved.  (Counterfactual
# receipt: the interim byte-LCP build DID flip and delivered 160 fewer
# tokens -- warm_equal run 00:34-00:37 in the ledger.)
#
# Leg guard (BIN): T3 shows NO preference line, a warm/fork admit with
# cached == the watermark (the exact-splice reuse), 200 completion.
#
# Runs FROM the Mac over SSH.  End state: ds4-server killed, box free.
