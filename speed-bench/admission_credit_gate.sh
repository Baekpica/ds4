# speed-bench/admission_credit_gate.sh — Inc 0b: lifetime page-union
# admission credits (plan review 2.2).
#
# Every continuous admission now holds a CREDIT for its full normalized
# target min(prompt + decode budget, seq_cap) from install until the row
# ends; the admission verdicts charge the page UNION of resident bytes and
# every live credit.  Before this, only pending PROMPT targets were charged
# (`outstanding`), so a bank whose prefill landed lost its decode-growth
# commitment and later rows could promise the same headroom.
#
# Legs (all boots pin the plan: DS4_SERVER_COALESCE_MAX=4):
#   B width:   DEFAULT budget, 4 concurrent omitted-budget rows -> all four
#              admit, zero rejects (the plan budget = banks x full extent
#              covers four full-bank credits; publishes the default-384K
#              achieved width the plan requires).
#   A promise: budget pinned to 1.14x virtual/bank -> three omitted-budget
#              rows admit, the FOURTH is REJECTED AT ADMIT ('rejected on
#              comp-cache budget') and completes via the serial fallback
#              ('prompt start').  Sizing is MEASURED, not derived: at this
#              pinned shape (ctx 16384 x 4 banks, page 2 MiB, virtual
#              280 MiB/bank) the DS4_ADMIT_DEBUG verdict totals -- which
#              are timing-independent lifetime promises (resident +
#              projected credits) -- are union(1..4) = 171.3 / 213.3 /
#              297.3 / 339.3 MiB.  Neighbor banks share VMM edge pages
#              (per-layer strides ~1.4 pages), so unions sit FAR below
#              k x virtual/bank; the pin 1.14 x 280 = 319 MiB lands
#              between union(3) and union(4) with ~20 MiB margin each way.
#   C release: after every leg-A row is dead (dead-client reap), a new row
#              admits with NO new reject -- credits released.
#   C2 prefill-abort: a deep prompt killed mid-prefill releases its credit
#              (interrupted checkpoint path); a follow-up row admits clean.
#
# External live-memory loss stays mem_floor_gate.sh's leg; this gate's boots
# assert the floor line NEVER fires (budget rejects only).
# Runs FROM the Mac over SSH.  End state: ds4-server killed, box left free.
